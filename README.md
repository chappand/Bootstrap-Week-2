# Bootstrap-Week-2
This project was to build a website that would contain responsive bootstrap elements. 

In this project you will find sticky footers, cards, forms, images, navbar's, etc.

To go along with the bootstrap css that automatically goes into it, I add my own css to suplement things.

This is supposed to be the framework to be able showcase my abilities.
